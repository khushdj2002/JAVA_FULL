# Hash Table
## Hash Table is one of the most important DS that uses a special function known as a hash function that maps a given value with a key to aaccess the element faster.

## hash Function assign each value wiith a unique key. Sometimes hash table uses an imperfect hash function that causes a collision because the hash function generates the same key of two different values.(Drawback of Hash function).
