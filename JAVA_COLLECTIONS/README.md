The Collection in Java is a framework that provides an architecture to store and manipulate the group of objects.

Java Collections can achieve all the operations that you perform on a data such as searching, sorting, insertion, manipulation, and deletion.

Java Collection means a single unit of objects. Java Collection framework provides many interfaces (Set, List, Queue, Deque) and classes (ArrayList, Vector, LinkedList, PriorityQueue, HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet).![Alt text](https://static.javatpoint.com/images/java-collection-hierarchy.png)

# In priority queue is like the inserted value will be in serted as a binary tree but in a array so when we remove or poll in priority queue thr order is going to change.
## Using poll() in priorityQueue will remove the head of the queue and if no head it will return null
## Using remove() it does the same as poll but throws Exception if there is no head.
# We can't add duplicate in set thats the advantage of set
